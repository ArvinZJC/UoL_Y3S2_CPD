The app is a React Native app set up by Expo CLI developed as the artefact of Assessment 1 of the course **Cross-Platform Development** during Semester 2 of Year 3 of BSc (Hons) Computer Science in UoL. It uses Expo managed workflow. Its name is **X Health** and it can basically monitor the user's steps and weight. It is not a perfect one, but reflects the knowledge gained from the course. Some screenshots are shown as follows (Figures 1 - 6). For more info about the app, please turn to the relevant report.
