# My First Snack App

The app is developed in the Week 1's workshop. It enables the user to switch between the home activity and the profile activity. It can also create a new profile screen.

The app is developed using Expo which is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React. You can also find the source code of the app on [the snack](https://snack.expo.io/@arvinzjc/cpd-w1-ws). You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by clicking the **Run** button or use the simulator by clicking **Tap to Play**. By 18 February 2020, everything looks good with the platform.

When you are ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Export** your project and use it with [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html).

Snack is Open Source. You can find the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/expo/snack-web).
